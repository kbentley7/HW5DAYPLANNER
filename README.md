# HW5DAYPLANNER
This is an application for a Day Planner calendar that allows the user to save events each day on the hour. The app uses HTML CSS propelled by jQuery to run in the browser. The app is based on a regular business day from 9am to 5pm. Therefore, the user may place events within that time frame for each hour. In addition, the events are saved into local storage once the user clicks the save button for the chosen hour. This affords the user the peace of mind that all events would be saved once the app page is refeshed.

In an effort to make the calender copacetic, the time blocks are colored to determine past, present and future affairs. Past time blocks are colored gray, current time blocks are red and future time blocks are green. As an added feature the app checks every minute whether the hour has changed to re-color the time blocks, so the user doesn't have to refresh for the colors to update as time passes.
